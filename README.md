# Playlist-fn-images
fortnite playlist images used for custom backends

# Are they complete ?

yes they are, for each season they have there base gamemode images

missing : S6

btw duos s7 and s13 squads are enhanced by ai cause the quaility was bad

for arena i added s12 since thats all i found but tbh it could be used for all seasons since they look default to me and not specific to the season

### Are there ltms images?

yes but not all of them only important ones which are 50 ltms (if i wanted to add more it will take alot of time)

## Contribution
contributions are welcome that will help me get anything if i had smth missing (make sure they are 512x512 or 500x500 for base gamemodes and ltms ahould be for the big tile now what i have found is 1000x563 is good (if you have any img that isnt these sizes send them to me at my discord @Marvelco)

# Credits to epic games they are the owner of these images if epic games want me to take it down pls contact me at my discord (@marvelco) and i will 100% comply and remove this repo
### they where very hard to get so pls if you use them credit me it would mean soo much to me
